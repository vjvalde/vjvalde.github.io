    <ul>
        <li><span class="red"><i>Tables</i></span></li>
        <li>Headers</li>
        <li><span class="purple"> Footers</span></li>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>Cover pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and other <span class="doc">document building blocks.</span></p>
    <h1 class="med" style="text-align:center;">MEDIA</h1>
    <p>When you create <span class="pcd">pictures, charts, or diagrams</span>, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the <span class="text">selected text</span> from the <span class="quick">Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab</span>.</p>
    <h2 class="format">FORMAT TEXT </hr> </h2>
    <p>You can also format text <span class="dir">directly </span> by using the other controls on the Home tab.
